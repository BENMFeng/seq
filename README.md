## Dependencies

- [LLVM](https://llvm.org)
- [Boehm GC](https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc)
- [OCaml](http://www.ocaml.org)

Note: LLVM 6.0.1 or greater is required. However, due to a LLVM 7 [bug](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40656) with coroutines (which are used extensively in Seq), we highly recommend building with LLVM 6.

## Build

Make sure the `LLVM_DIR` environment variable is set (to the result of `llvm-config --cmakedir`). Then:

```bash
mkdir seq/build
cd seq/builld
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

This will produce a `seq` executable for compiling/running Seq progrms, and a `seqtest` executable for running the test suite.


## Documentation

[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org), [Breathe](https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Exhale](https://exhale.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) are required to compile the documentation. Once these are installed, just:

```bash
cd seq/docs
make html
```

You can then open `_build/html/index.html` with your browser.
